title: "magrittr vs native pipes"
---

The `magrittr` pipe `%>%` functions almost the same as the native R pipe `|>`.  However, in some situations it does not.  Consider the example below.

## Example

Assume we have the following vector and we need to add `#` in front and end of each element.

```{r}
(lst = c("apple", "banana"))
```


### Using `magrittr` Pipe

```{r}
library(magrittr)
lst %>% 
  paste("#", ., "#")
```

### Using R Native Pipe

```{r}
#| eval: false

# this won't work...
lst |>  
  paste("#", ., "#")
```

```{r}
# ...we need anonymous function, . can be replaced with any other names
lst |>  
  (\(.) paste("#", ., "#"))()
```
